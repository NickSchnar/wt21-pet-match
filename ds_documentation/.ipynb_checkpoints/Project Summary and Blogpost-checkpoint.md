1. Project Summary

"Pet Match - Get matched with the right pet". This is not just our motto, instead it is our deep believe that we as Pet Match can help to reduce the amount of returned pets to the shelters. For that we analized the present situation which is taking place in many pets shelters these nowadays and figured out that following problems.

● Failed adoptions mean pets were adopted and returned.
● People usually return a pet because the pet was not what they expected.
● This is a huge problem for independent shelters that have to allocate resources for that returning pet.
● Pets are usually brought from other countries in Europe, so it’s even harder to return to the original shelter.
● Failed adoptions can traumatize even more an animal that was already in a confusing/sad situation.
